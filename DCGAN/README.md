# Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN)
DCGANs aim to incorporate Convolutional Neural Network layers into their architecture to improve their efficacy over basic GANs for applications such as image generation. As a result of these CNN layers, DCGANs develop certain data and architectural constraints. This project was the development of a DCGAN to generate human-like, handwritten digits. The dataset used for training this DCGAN was the widely known MNIST dataset.

The two image results below describe the progress of the model from its first attempt at creating such handwritten digits, to the final one before training was stopped. The paper who's teachings were followed can be found in this directory. Although the paper appears to have acheived excellent results, the DCGAN trained here was not as effective. While many of the trained model's output digits appear handwritten, many do not - and this is a relatively easy task.
