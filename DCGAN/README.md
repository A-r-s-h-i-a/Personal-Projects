# Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN)
This project was the development of a DCGAN to generate human-like, handwritten digits. The dataset used for training was the widely known MNIST dataset. The two images below describe the progress of the model from its first attempt at creating such digits, to the final one before training was stopped. Tensorflow was the machine learning library used, and the paper who's teachings were followed can be found in this directory.
