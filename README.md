# Personal-Projects
This repository holds many of my personal projects since 2020, projects I started and finished with the ultimate goal of expanding my skills as a software engineer. Nearly all of these are Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning projects, written in Python with Tensorflow. There are five projects currently:

1. Music Generation || A sequence model (LSTM) which generates melodies
2. Face Tracking || A script utilizing OpenCV (Haar Cascade Classifier, cv2) to identify and track faces from video streams
3. Explainable AI || A complement to an agent, an algorithm (RISE, XAI) which sheds light on the reasoning behind its decisions
4. Actor Critic || A reinforcement learning algorithm applied to OpenAI Gym's CartPole environment
5. Dueling Double DQN || A reinforcement learning algorithm applied to OpenAI Gym's LunarLander environment

I have carried out many other projects, but they are not included here for a variety of reasons including a lack of flair. These other projects include:

* Spiking Neurons || A custom spiking neuron implementation of the DQN algorithm, applied to OpenAI Gym's CartPole environment
* Genetic Algorithm || A genetic algorithm approach (with NEAT) to OpenAI Gym's MountainCar environment
* Computer Vision || A variety of computer vision supervised learning solutions to datasets like CIFAR, MNIST, etc.
* Neural Network from Scratch || A custom neural network, with the neurons, backpropagation function, etc. built from the ground up
* Audio Classification || A system which builds Mel Spectrograms of urban and instrumental sounds, then classifies
