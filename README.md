# Personal-Projects
This repository holds many of my personal projects since 2020, projects I started and finished with the ultimate goal of expanding my skills as a software engineer. Nearly all of these are Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning projects, written in Python with Tensorflow. There are five projects currently:
1. Music Generation  &nbsp;&nbsp; || A sequence model (LSTM) which generates melodies
2. Face Tracking &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; || A script utilizing OpenCV (Haar Cascade Classifier) to identify and track faces from video streams
3. Explainable AI || A complement to an agent, an algorithm (RISE, XAI) which sheds light on the reasoning behind its decisions
4. Actor Critic || A reinforcement learning algorithm applied to OpenAI Gym's CartPole environment
5. Dueling Double DQN || A reinforcement learning algorithm applied to OpenAI Gym's LunarLander environment
6. Neural Network from Scratch || A custom neural network, with the neurons, backpropagation function, etc. built from the ground up
7. Random Forest from Scratch || A random forest algorithm, with the decision tree object and associated methods built from the ground up

I have carried out many other projects, but they are not included here for a variety of reasons including a lack of flair. A few of these other projects include:
* Spiking Neurons || A custom spiking neuron implementation of the DQN algorithm, applied to OpenAI Gym's CartPole environment
* Genetic Algorithm || A genetic algorithm approach (with NEAT) to OpenAI Gym's MountainCar environment
* Computer Vision || A variety of computer vision supervised learning solutions to datasets like CIFAR, MNIST, etc.
* Audio Classification || A system which builds Mel Spectrograms of urban and instrumental sounds, then classifies them

# Background
Hello and thanks for stopping by! I've been a developer since graduating from UC Davis in 2016, and have found that one of my favorite parts of programming is that it uniquely positions you in other industries. Learning is my passion, and this sort of work means that I am constantly learning - not just about software engineering, but also about other fields. To date, I have been a software engineer (mainly a Python developer) writing code for deep space imaging/gravitational lensing analysis, animal gene-editing single-cell control systems, and artificial intelligence applications in the Space & Defense industry to name just a few.
Currently, as you'll see if you explore my projects, I have been focused on learning and staying up-to-date with the exciting field of Artificial Intelligence.
