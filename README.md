# Personal-Projects
This repository holds many of my personal projects since 2020, projects I started and finished with the ultimate goal of expanding my skills as a software engineer. Nearly all of these are Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning projects, written in Python with Tensorflow. There are five projects currently:

1. Music Generation || Sequence Models, LSTMs
2. Face Tracking || OpenCV Haar Cascade Classifier, cv2
3. Explainable AI || RISE Algorithm, XAI
4. Actor Critic || Reinforcement Learning Algorithm, OpenAI Gym's CartPole Environment
5. Dueling Double DQN || Reinforcement Learning Algorithm, OpenAI Gym's Lunar Lander

I have carried out many other projects, but they are not included here for a variety of reasons including a lack of flair. These other projects include:

* Spiking Neurons || DQN, OpenAI Gym's CartPole environment
* Genetic Algorithm || GA for OpenAI Gym's MountainCar Environment
* Computer Vision || CIFAR/MNIST, Supervised Learning
* Neural Network from Scratch || Neurons & Associated Training Functions
* Audio Classification || Urban Sound & Instrument Classification, Mel Spectrograms, FFT, CNN/BN
