# Actor Critic Reinforcement Learning
The Actor Critic algorithm is a temporal difference, policy-gradient reinforcement learning algorithm. It has two networks, an Actor network and a Critic network. The Actor decides which action should be taken by the model, and the Critic informs the Actor how good the action was and how it should adjust. The learning of the Actor is based on policy-gradient approaches, and the Critic essentially calculates the value function to measure Actor performance.
