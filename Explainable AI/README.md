# Explainable AI (XAI)
Here the Randomized Input Sampling for Explanation (RISE) algorithm is employed to shed light on the decision-making factors of a computer vision model. RISE is a technique for identifying what the key decision-making factors are for a Computer Vision model. It operates by measuring the importance of pixels/collections of pixels to the decision-making process of a Computer Vision model via perturbing it/them and observing how the model's output is affected. This model in question, VGG, is first trained to identify images of apples and oranges. Next, RISE is applied and the output of the full system given.
