# Neural Network
These are a collection of files building a neural network from scratch. Everything from the neurons, mathematics associated with forward and backpropagation, activation functions, and more are constructed from the ground-up here. The system is then tested in a simple supervised learning algorithm on the Titanic dataset, identifying who lived and who died as proof that it is functioning correctly.
