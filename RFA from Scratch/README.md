# Random Forest Algorithm
Here a Random Forest Algorithm (RFA) is implemented from scratch, everything from the decision tree objects to the bootstrapping function. It is then tested as a supervised learning algorithm to estimate wine quality as "good" or "bad" on a dataset that is 56% "good".

# Results
This RFA implementation performed with around 80% accuracy.
