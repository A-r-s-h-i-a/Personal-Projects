# Dueling Double Deep Q Network
Deep Q Learning (DQN) uses a Neural Network (NN) to learn a policy, replacing "Q Tables" in the original Q Learning algorithm. This approach enables agents to operate in continuous environments where large amounts of input data must be processed for any hope of good performance.
